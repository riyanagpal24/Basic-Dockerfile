# Basic-Dockerfile
A basic code for creating and understanding docker images.
<h3>Dockerfile</h3>
<p>Docker file build on a base image of Ubuntu and runs a nginx proxy server</p>
<h3>Index.html</h3>
<p>It contains a basic html code to verify a successfull run of the image on localhost</p>

<h4>Note :</h4> If the image doesn't run on https://localhost then obtain the machine default ip by issuing a command "docker-machine ip deafult"
on docker-toolbox. Use that as a localhost instead.
